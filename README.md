<h1>Whine Free Wine (with Majestic data)</h1>
<p>Code from my first big project. The idea was that it would scrape the Internet for wine lists and stick them all in a searchable database. Sadly I couldn't figure out a way to mass-scrape wine lasts bar going through them one by one, so the idea never really took off, but as my first big project I was really happy with it.</p>
<p>So index.php is the main page where you input what you want. Searching takes you to findmywine-result.php. The findmywine.css is obviously the style sheet, while the template_top.php reflects the fact that the live project is on my <a href="https://williamfro.st/portfolio/whinefreewine/index.php" target="_blank">website</a>, so that just keeps it fitting in with the general schema up there. I haven't uploaded jquery.tablesorter.js because it's massive and makes the whole programme look like it's written in JavaScript, but it's easily available online elsewhere.</p>
<p>All of the data comes from the Majestic Wine website, scraped and stuck in the database with the scrape.py programme. I've also stuck the SQL code to create the database was create_db.sql. It works for c. 720/740 wines on the Majestic website as of 02/08/2020. Obviously all the data belongs to Majestic.</p>
