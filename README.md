# whinefreewine_public
Code from my first big project. The idea was that it would scrape the Internet for wine lists and stick them all in a searchable database. Sadly I couldn't figure out a way to mass-scrape wine lasts bar going through them one by one, so the idea never really took off, but as my first big project I was really happy with it.
