<h1>Whine Free Wine (with Majestic data)</h1>
<p>Code from my first big project. The idea was that it would scrape the Internet for wine lists and stick them all in a searchable database. Sadly I couldn't figure out a way to mass-scrape wine lasts bar going through them one by one, so the idea never really took off, but as my first big project I was really happy with it.</p>
<p>All of the data comes from the Majestic Wine website, scraped and stuck in the database with the scrape.py programme. I've also stuck the SQL code to create the database was create_db.sql. Obviously all the data belongs to Majestic.</p>
